        Kolli Hills is one of the beautiful places, situated in Namakkal District of the state of Tamil Nadu. This beautiful location is referred to as the Kolli Malai, and it means the â€˜Mountains of Death.' The hills are over almost 1000 to 1300 meters in height that cover more than 280 sq. Km. You will get nearly 70 hairpin bends, which take the tourists to the top of the hill. Furthermore, the hills are actually the part of discontinuous Eastern Ghats.
The early Hindu literature talks about the actual existence of the Kolli Pavai ghost on the top of these hills and in this way, they have earned the ultimate destination this name. This image or spirit used to tempt the wayfarers and kill them. So, if you are a travel buff, you would surely love to roam around the entire place to explore the beauty of nature as well.
